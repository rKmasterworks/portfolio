# Week 2 – Linux CLI

Covered most of this during VG2 IT. Spent a day reviewing:

✅ Refreshed:
- Navigating file system (`ls`, `cd`, `find`)
- File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- `grep`, `less`, `tail` for logs
- SSH and SCP usage
- Basic bash scripting

🛠️ Practiced using:
- WSL2 Ubuntu
- TLDR pages
- OverTheWire Bandit (Levels 0-3)

No need to spend more time here — ready for next part
