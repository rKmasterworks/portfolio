# 🌩️ Week 4 – Cloud Concepts

## ✅ Goals for the Week
- Understand core cloud computing principles
- Learn the differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
- Explore cloud deployment models
- Begin thinking in cloud-native patterns

---

## 🌥️ What is Cloud Computing?
Brief summary of what cloud computing is and why it's used.  


---

## 🧱 Cloud Service Models

### IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service
- You manage: OS, apps, runtime, data
- Provider manages: virtualization, servers, storage, network
- Example: Azure Virtual Machines, AWS EC2

### PaaS – Platform as a Service
- You manage: apps and data
- Provider manages everything else
- Example: Azure App Service, Heroku

### SaaS – Software as a Service
- Fully managed software for end-users
- Example: Gmail, Microsoft 365

## 🗺️ Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud** – Azure, AWS, GCP  
- **Private Cloud** – Company-hosted cloud infrastructure  
- **Hybrid Cloud** – Combines public and private  
- **Multicloud** – Uses multiple public cloud providers
