# 🌩️ Week 4 – Cloud Concepts

## ✅ Goals for the Week
- Understand core cloud computing principles
- Learn the differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
- Explore cloud deployment models
- Begin thinking in cloud-native patterns

---

## 🌥️ What is Cloud Computing?
Brief summary of what cloud computing is and why it's used.  


---

## 🧱 Cloud Service Models

### IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service
- You manage: OS, apps, runtime, data
- Provider manages: virtualization, servers, storage, network
- Example: Azure Virtual Machines, AWS EC2

### PaaS – Platform as a Service
- You manage: apps and data
- Provider manages everything else
- Example: Azure App Service, Heroku

### SaaS – Software as a Service
- Fully managed software for end-users
- Example: Gmail, Microsoft 365

## 🗺️ Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud** – Azure, AWS, GCP  
- **Private Cloud** – Company-hosted cloud infrastructure  
- **Hybrid Cloud** – Combines public and private  
- **Multicloud** – Uses multiple public cloud providers

## ⚡ Key Benefits of Cloud
- Scalability  
- Elasticity  
- Pay-as-you-go pricing  
- Global reach  
- High availability  
- Disaster recovery

## 🎓 Learning Resources

- 🌐 [Azure Fundamentals Learning Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-fundamentals/)
- 📺 [FreeCodeCamp: Cloud Computing for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LaAJq1lB1Q)
- 📺 [IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gke0Lt8v5M)

---

## 🧪 Practice (Optional)
- ✅ Create a free Azure account
- ✅ Explore the Azure Portal UI

---

## 🗒️ Notes / Reflections
- Shared responsibility model: Split responsbility between Cloud Provider and Consumer
- CapEx is a one-time up-front payment to secure resources (e.g building a datasenter)
- OpEx is spending money on services over time (e.g leasing, renting)
