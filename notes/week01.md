## 📝 Notes
- Git is a version control system used to track code changes and collaborate with others.
- Useful commands:
  - `git init` – start a new repo
  - `git status` – check what’s changed
  - `git add .` – stage all changes
  - `git commit -m "msg"` – commit staged changes
  - `git log` – view commit history
  - `git branch` – list branches
  - `git checkout -b new-branch` – create + switch branch
- Visualization from [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org) is great for mastering branching concepts.

## 🤔 Reflections

- Need more practice with merging and resolving conflicts.

## ✅ Goals for Next Week
