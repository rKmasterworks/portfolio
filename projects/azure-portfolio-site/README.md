# Azure Portfolio Site (In Progress 🚀)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **work-in-progress project** where I’m building a personal website hosted on **Azure**, with full **CI/CD automation** and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using **Terraform**.  
The goal is to turn this into a living portfolio project that demonstrates practical **Cloud Engineering** and **DevOps** skills.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Deploy a **static website** on Azure (Static Web Apps or Blob Storage).  
- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions.  
- Define infrastructure using **Terraform** instead of manual portal clicks.  
- Experiment with **Azure services** (Key Vault, Monitor, CDN, Front Door).  
- Document and iterate on the project as if it were a real-world deployment.

## 🛠 Planned Tech Stack
- **Azure**: Static Web Apps, Blob Storage, Key Vault, Monitor  
- **IaC**: Terraform (Azure provider)  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions  
- **Optional Iterations**: Azure Functions, App Service, Containers, AKS  

---

## 📅 Roadmap
- [ ] **Phase 1:** Deploy static site manually in Azure.  
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Add GitHub Actions for CI/CD.  
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Move infra into Terraform configs.  
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Add monitoring, secrets management, CDN.  
- [ ] **Phase 5:** Explore containers & AKS deployment.

## 📖 Notes
This project is part of my **Cloud Engineering learning path**.  
I’m starting small, then **iterating step by step** to simulate how real engineers improve infrastructure over time.
